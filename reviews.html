         <p>I can't get enough of these! I can finish this whole box in one sitting if no one stops me &#128514;. Hands down these are the best macarons I have tried in Saskatoon so far! I've tried a bunch from patisseries and online sellers, but there's always something missing that qualifies for perfection. Soulful should be the standard and quality other business should strive for.</p>

         <p>I was buying my macarons from one of the other well known boutique shops in town, but... after finding Soulful I have been converted! They are THE BEST tasting and have the best flavours! Not just that, but you're supporting a small business with some of the best customer service around. It just doesn't get any better than that! I just cannot recommend them enough &#128151; PS... the custom cakes are amazing!</p>

         <p>My husband bought me a cake from Soulful and it was both delicious and beautiful! And so unique! If you're bored of the same old Birthday cakes and you like macarons, here's something awesome to try!</p>

         <p>Highly recommend! We tried one of each flavour they had available and they all tasted great, can't choose a favourite! It is the perfect amount of sweetness and the filling is creamy and flavourful!</p>
